🌤 Weather App — Project Description

I developed a Weather App that allows users to check real-time weather information of any city. The project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the help of API integration guidance from ChatGPT. The app uses live weather data from the OpenWeather API and displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions in a clean and responsive UI.

Whenever a user enters a city name, the application fetches weather details using the fetch() method and updates the UI without reloading the page. Proper error handling is included — if the user enters an invalid city, it shows an alert message instead of crashing. The design is simple and user-friendly, and weather icons are updated dynamically based on conditions like sunny, clouds, rain, etc.

This project helped me understand how to work with REST APIs, JSON parsing, and DOM manipulation in JavaScript. I also learned how to style responsive layouts using CSS and make real-time applications using web technologies.

Key Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I gained practical experience in:
✔ API integration and handling live data
✔ Using JavaScript fetch() and JSON parsing
✔ DOM manipulation to update UI dynamically
✔ Building responsive layouts using CSS
✔ Implementing validation and error handling in web apps

Why This Project is Useful

This Weather App demonstrates how real-time applications are built and how external APIs can be integrated into front-end development. It reflects concepts related to real-world projects, such as asynchronous programming, UI/UX design, and web responsiveness.
